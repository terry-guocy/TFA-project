# TFA Final Project: Squirrel Tracker

## Introduction

In this project, we used Django to build an app that tracks all the squirrels in Central Park. Based on the original data file of the squirrel sightings from 2018, we allow users to add new sightings and plot out the result of summary statistics as well as sighting locations on a visual map.
